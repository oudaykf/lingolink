          <h2>Our Story</h2>
          <p>
            Founded in 2025, LingoLink emerged from a simple yet powerful vision: to make legal translation 
            accessible, accurate, and efficient for organizations worldwide. Our founders, experienced legal 
            professionals and linguists, recognized the critical need for specialized translation services 
            in an increasingly globalized legal landscape.
